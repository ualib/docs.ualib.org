Introduction
-------------

In this appendix we describe the various features and aspects of Agda_, the proof assistant and programming language in and for which the Agda Universal Algebra Library (agda-ualib_) is implemented.

Some of the topics discussed here involve the `Agda Standard Library`_.

Types and terms in Martin-Lof type theory
-------------------------------------------

Agda is an extension of :term:`Martin-Lof Type Theory`,  which is an extension of the :term:`lambda calculus`.

The substitution of ``a`` for every occurrence of ``x`` in the term ``t`` is denoted by some authors as ``t[a/x]`` and by other authors as ``[a/x]t``.  Both expressions are read as "``a`` for ``x`` in ``t``."

Type theory is founded upon judgments.  A **typing judgment** is a judgment of the form ``t:T``, which expresses the assertion, "the term ``t`` is of type ``T``."  Equivalent means of expressing the same judgment are the following: "``t`` *has* type ``T``," "``t`` *inhabits* ``T``," and "``t`` is an *inhabitant* of ``T``."

Thus, the colon symbol is a relation from terms to types, and the pair ``(t, T)`` belongs to this relation iff ``t:T`` iff ``t`` has type ``T``.

Technically, each term inhabits exactly one type so ``:`` is actually a *function* (from the collection of terms to the collection of types).  [1]_, [2]_

A **term** in type theory is one of the following:

* A **constant** is a named, typed declaration. For example, ``nat.zero`` is a constant of type ``nat``. The constructors and recursor of an inductive type can be viewed as constants.

* A **lambda abstraction** inhabits a function type. If ``t:T`` is a term in which a variable ``x:A`` (possibly) appears, then the lambda abstraction ``λ(x:A),t`` is a term of type ``Π(x:A),T``.

* An **application** is formed by applying a term of function type (e.g., ``α → β``) to an argument (e.g., of type ``α``). Function application is denoted by *apposition*. More precisely, a function's argument appears immediately after the function symbol; e.g., ``M: α → β`` applied to ``N: α`` is denoted by ``M N``.

* A **type universe** is a type of types. We denote the type universe at *level* ``u`` by ``Type u``. Type universes usually appear as the second (right-hand side) argument of the colon ``:`` relation.  However, type universes are themselves terms in the language, and each term has a type.  The type of ``Type u`` is the type universe that is one level higher than ``u``; that is, ``Type u: Type (u+1)``.  (See also the section on :ref:`agdas-type-hierarchy` below.)

Terms of TT have a computational interpretation. There are reduction rules that define an :term:`equivalence relation` on the set of terms. The application of a :term:`Pi <Pi type>` or lambda abstraction to a term of the abstracted type reduces to a substitution: that is, if ``T:B`` and ``a:A``, then ``(λx:A,T) a`` reduces to ``T[a/x]``.

Two terms that are equivalent under this notion of reduction are said to be :term:`definitionally equal`. This sense of equality is distinct from the internal notion of equality (defined below).

.. _agdas-type-hierarchy:

Agda's type hierarchy
-----------------------

The structure of type universes varies between implementations of the CIC. To consistently include general inductive types, the CIC is organized as a hierarchy of type universes ``Sort u``, for ``u ≥ 0``, such that ``Sort u: Sort (u+1)``. The rules for computing the universe level of inductively defined types are subtle and discussed in :cite:`Coquand:1990` and :cite:`deMoura:2014`.

Like its more mature cousins Coq_ and Agda_, Agda takes for its logical foundations *dependent type theory* with *inductive types* and a countable hierarchy of *universes*. However, unlike Coq or Agda, Agda's universes are *non-cumulative*. This is not a problem since, in places where we might exploit universe cumulativity in Coq, we can instead use :term:`universe polymorphism` and lifting constructions.

Here is a brief summary of the explanation given in the `Agda Reference Manual`_ of the correspondence between ``Sort`` and ``Type``.

(See also the section of the `Agda Tutorial`_ called `Universe Levels <http://agdaprover.github.io/tutorial/06_Inductive_Types.html>`_.)

  Every type in Agda is, by definition, an expression of type ``Set ℓ`` for some universe level ``ℓ``. A universe level is one of the following:

  * a natural number, ``n``
  * a universe variable, ``u`` (declared with the command universe or universes)
  * an expression ``u + n``, where ``u`` is a universe level and ``n`` is a natural number
  * an expression ``max u v``, where ``u`` and ``v`` are universes
  * an expression ``imax u v``, where ``u`` and ``v`` are universe levels

  The last one denotes the universe level 0 if ``v`` is 0, and ``max u v`` otherwise.

.. proof:example::

   Let's see some actual Agda code demonstrating some of the assertions above.

   ::

     universes u v                -- Agda Output
                                  -- -----------
     #check Sort u                -- Sort u: Type u
     #check Sort 5                -- Type 4: Type 5
     #check Sort (u + 1)          -- Type u: Type (u+1)
     #check Sort (u + 3)          -- Type (u+2): Type (u+3)
     #check Sort (max u v)        -- Sort (max u v): Type (max u v)
     #check Sort (max (u + 3) v)  -- Sort (max (u+3) v): Type (max (u+3) v)
     #check Sort (imax (u + 3) v) -- Sort (imax (u+3) v): Type (imax (u+3) v)
     #check Prop                  -- Prop : Type
     #check Type                  -- Type : Type 1

.. index:: keyword: Type, Type 0, Type 1, ...

In Agda, ``Type`` is an abbreviation for ``Type 0``, which is an abbreviation for ``Sort 1``.

Agda has a hierarchy of ω-many type universe levels. We want some operations to be *polymorphic* over type universes.

.. proof:example::

   ``list α`` should make sense for any type ``α``, no matter which universe ``α`` lives in. This explains why ``list`` has the following type signature:

   ::

      #check @list    -- answer: Type u → Type u

   Here ``u`` is a variable ranging over type levels.

Think of ``Type 0`` as a universe of "small" or "ordinary" types.

``Type 1`` is a larger universe, and ``Type 0`` *inhabits* (is an *element* of) ``Type 1``.

``Type 2`` is an even larger universe of types which contains ``Type 1`` as an element, etc.

The list is infinite---for every natural number ``n`` there exists ``Type (n-1)`` and ``Type n``, and ``Type (n-1)`` has type ``Type n`` (i.e., ``Type (n-1): Type n``).

.. index:: ! predicative, ! ramified, ! impredicative
.. index:: keyword: Prop

The upshot of this **ramified** arrangement is that the types described above are :term:`predicative`, which means that their definitions are not self-referential.

By avoiding self-referential definitions, we avoid Russel's paradox.

On the other hand, in some special situations we *do* want to employ a self-referential type, so Agda supplies us with exactly one. It is the type ``Prop`` of propositions, and it is :term:`impredicative` (self-referential).

-----------------------

.. _implicit-arguments:

Implicit arguments
-----------------------

Agda's support of implicit arguments and type-inference is quite powerful and extremely helpful. The `TPL`_ sections on `Implicit Arguments`_ and `More on Implicit Arguments`_ explain this topic in detail.  In the present section we merely collect a few fine points and technicalities that are relevant to our development of the Agda Universal Algebra Library (`agda-ualib`_).

By default, Agda inserts, and eagerly tries to infer the types of, implicit arguments.

.. proof:example::

   ::

     -- Aggressive type inference.

     definition id₁ {α: Type} (x: α): α := x
     #check id₁    -- ℕ → ℕ

   In this case, Agda behaves a bit presumptuously---the type ``α`` is not known, so there's no evidence for the typing judgments ``x: ℕ`` nor ``id₁: ℕ → ℕ``.

   If instead we use double curly braces ``{{ … }}`` (or their unicode equivalent ``⦃ … ⦄``) this tells the parser to be more conservative about inserting the argument and inferring its type. [3]_

   ::

     -- Conservative type inference.

     definition id₂ ⦃α: Type⦄ (x: α): α := x
     #check id₂     -- Π ⦃α: Type⦄, α → α

.. _the-elaboration-engine:

Elaboration engine
-----------------------


On top of the Agda kernel there is a powerful *elaboration engine* that can

#. infer implicit universe variables;

#. infer implicit arguments, using higher order unification;

#. support overloaded notation or declarations;

#. insert coercions;

#. infer implicit arguments using type classes;

#. convert readable proofs to proof terms

#. construct terms using tactics

Agda does most of these things simultaneously. For example, the term constructed by type classes can be used to find out implicit arguments for functions.

(For a nice overview of the elaboration engine, see this `2015 post by Floris van Doorn`_.)

.. _dependent-types-in-agda:

Dependent types in Agda
-----------------------

In this section we describe some of the most important :term:`dependent types <dependent type>` in Agda.

(For a more general discussion of dependent types, please see the :ref:`section on type theory <type-theory>` and, more specifically, the :ref:`subsection on dependent types <dependent-types>`.)

.. _pi-type-sec:

Pi type
~~~~~~~

The **Pi type**

  ``Π(x:A),B x``

is called a **dependent function type**. It generalizes the (nondependent) function type ``A → B``.

To see why ``Π(x:A),B x`` is a *dependent type*, consider the following example: a function ``f: Π(x:A),B x`` implies for each ``a:A`` the typing judgment ``f a: B a``, where the type ``B a`` *depends* on the value ``a``.

::

  variables {α : Type*} {π : α → Type*}

  def pi (i : set α) (s : Πa, set (π a)) : set (Πa, π a) :=
  { f | ∀ a ∈ i, f a ∈ s a }

.. index:: ! type of; dependent pairs

.. _sigma-type-sec:

Sigma type
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Sigma type**

  ``Σ(x:A),B x``

is called a **dependent pair type**.  It generalizes the Cartesian product ``A × B``.

To see why ``Σ(x:A),B x`` is a *dependent type*, consider the following example: a pair ``(a,b): Σ(x:A),B x`` implies the typing judgments ``a:A`` and ``b: B a``, where the type ``B a`` *depends* on the value ``a``.

::

  structure sigma {α : Type u} (β : α → Type v) :=
  mk :: (fst : α) (snd : β fst)

  structure psigma {α : Sort u} (β : α → Sort v) :=
  mk :: (fst : α) (snd : β fst)

-----------------------------------

.. index:: inductive type

.. _inductive-types-in-agda:

Inductive types in Agda
-------------------------

Types can be defined inductively, by providing a list of their **constructors**, which, as their name suggests, indicate how to *construct* inhabitants of the type.

.. proof:example::

   * The **empty type** is an inductive type with no constructors.

   * The **unit type** is an inductive type with one constructor, ``unit.star: unit``

   * the **natural number type** is an inductive type with two constructors,

       ``nat.zero : nat``
    
       ``nat.succ : nat → nat``

Every inductive type has an associated **recursor** (or, **destructor**), which is a term describing how to define a function mapping out of the type.

.. proof:example::

   To define ``f: nat → int`` using ``nat.rec``, we provide two arguments. The first is the value of ``f (nat.zero)``; the second (of type ``nat → int → int``), is the value of ``f (nat.succ n)``, which is defined in terms of ``n`` and the value of ``f n``.

In addition, the application of the recursor for an inductive type I to a closed term i : I
reduces to the application to i of the corresponding case of the recursor. If f : nat → nat is
defined using nat.rec , as above, with arguments k : nat and λ m v, t , then f nat.zero reduces
to k and f (nat.succ n) reduces to t[n/m][(f n)/v] .
Following the Curry–Howard correspondence [85], propositions can be expressed in the same
language as datatypes. One can think of a term P : Type as a proposition, and a term p : P as a

.. _classical-reasoning:

Classical reasoning in Agda
-----------------------------------------

Our presentation in this brief subsection was informed by the nice discussion in the `Axioms and Computation`_ section of the `Theorem Proving in Agda`_ tutorial.  Some points from the tutorial are repeated here for clarity and to keep this presentation self-contained.

The version of the :term:`Calculus of Inductive Constructions` (CiC) implemented in Agda includes :term:`dependent function types <dependent function type>`, :term:`inductive types <inductive type>`, and (as explained above) a countable hierarchy of universes that starts with the :term:`impredicative` ``Prop`` type at the bottom.

Agda extends the :term:`CiC` with additional axioms and rules in order to make the language more expressive and versatile so that the statements of theorems and the constructions of proofs are simpler and more elegant.

Of course, adding axioms to a foundational system can be dangerous. Apart from the usual concerns about correctness and consistency, we also have to consider whether theorems and proofs expressed in the extended system have computational content.  This will depend on whether certain classical axioms are employed in the proofs.

Type theory in general (and Agda in particular) is designed to support both constructive (or "computational") reasoning *and* classical reasoning, and the assertion that type theory (or Agda) is at odds with classical reasoning is simply false. Rather, we can introduce classical reasoning withing the logical framework of type theory (and Agda) as desired, as long as we keep in mind that, if we do so, then our proofs may no longer have computational content.

If we adhere to the "computationally pure" fragment type theory, forgoing classical axioms and derivation rules, then we can rest assured that closed expressions in the system evaluate to :term:`canonical normal forms <canonical form>`. For example, every closed, computationally pure expression of type ℕ will reduce to a number.

.. _extensionality:

Extensionality
---------------------------

What makes Agda Special?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two axioms that the :term:`LSTL` adds to :term:`CiC` are :term:`proposition extensionality` and a :term:`quotient` construction, which in turn imply the principle of :term:`function extensionality`.  These extensions are used to develop theories of sets and finite sets, but as we will see,

  *using such axiomatic extensions can block evaluation in Agda's kernel*

so that closed terms of type ℕ may no longer evaluate to numbers.

On the other hand,

  *Agda erases types and propositional information when compiling definitions to* byte-code *for its virtual machine evaluator*,

and since these axioms only add new propositions, they admit a computational interpretation.

The :term:`LSTL` supports the classical :term:`law of the excluded middle` (em) as an optional axiom that the user can assume when necessary.  We can invoke ``em`` if we explicitly open the classical fragment of the library with the directive ``open classical``, and then we can write proofs that argue by case analysis on the two possible cases for a given proposition ``P``, that is, either ``P`` or ``¬ P``.

.. index:: elimination rule; (for disjunction)

.. proof:example::

   In classical logic, for all propositions ``P`` and ``Q`` the implication ``P → Q`` is equivalent to the disjunction ``¬ P ∨ Q``.  The left-to-right direction of this equivalence is proved in Agda using ``em``, as we now show.

   ::

     open classical

     example (P Q: Prop): (P → Q) → ¬ P ∨ Q :=
     assume f: P → Q,
     or.elim (em P)
       (assume h: P, or.inr (f h))
       (assume h: ¬ P, or.inl h)

   (Here's a brief dissection of the line ``or.elim (em P)`` from the last example, for the benefit of Agda novices who might be puzzled by it: ``or.elim`` means "apply the **disjunction elimination** rule", :math:`∨\mathrm E`.  In this case, we apply :math:`∨\mathrm E` to the disjunction ``em P``, that is, ``P ∨ ¬ P``, and the final two lines handle each disjunct in turn.)

   On the other hand, the converse---that is, ``¬ P ∨ Q → (P → Q)``---can be proved without the help of classical axioms, so the next block of code need not be preceded by ``open classical``.

   ::

     example (P Q: Prop): ¬ P ∨ Q → (P → Q) :=
     assume (h: ¬ P ∨ Q) (p: P), show Q, from
     or.elim h
       (assume np: ¬ P, false.elim (np p))
       (assume q : Q, q)

Like proposition extensionality, the use of :term:`em` may block evaluation in the Agda kernel, yet admit a computational interpretation after compilation to byte-code.

The `Agda Standard Library`_ also defines a :term:`Choice` principle, but this principle is entirely antithetical to a computational interpretation since it magically produces "data" from a proposition that asserts the existence of Choice.

The use of Choice is essential to some classical constructions and it can be imported in Agda when needed. However,

  *expressions that use Choice to produce data do not have any computational interpretation*.

Therefore, in Agda we must mark such definitions ``noncomputable``.

.. Diaconescu's theorem
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. A famous theorem of Diaconescu uses :term:`proposition extensionality`, :term:`function extensionality` and :term:`Choice` to derive the :term:`law of the excluded middle`. However, as noted above, use of :term:`em` is still compatible with :term:`bytecode` compilation and :term:`code extraction`, as are other classical principles, *as long as they are not used to manufacture data*.

To summarize, on top of the framework of universes, :term:`dependent function types <dependent function type>`, and :term:`inductive types <inductive type>`, the :term:`LSTL` adds three (optional) components:

+ the axiom of :term:`proposition extensionality`
+ a :term:`quotient` construction, which implies :term:`function extensionality`
+ a :term:`Choice` principle, which produces data from an existential proposition.

The first two of these are compatible with byte-code evaluation, despite blocking normalization within Agda, whereas the third does not admit computational interpretations. [4]_

Philosophical and foundational issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our presentation in this brief subsection is meant to merely summarize the nice discussion found in the `Historical and Philosophical Context <https://agdaprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_agda/axioms_and_computation.html#historical-and-philosophical-context>`_ section of `TPL`_.

It is widely accepted that computational considerations are important to mathematics, but there are different views about the best means of addressing these computational concerns.

+ *Constructively*, mathematics are not separate from their computational roots and every meaningful mathematical theorem should have a direct computational interpretation.

+ *Classically*, it may be more fruitful to maintain a separation of mathematical and computational concerns. One language (the constructive one) may be useful for writing computer programs, while the other (the nonconstructive language) may be useful for reasoning about such programs.

Agda is designed to support both approaches. Core parts of the library are developed constructively, but the system also supports classical mathematical reasoning.

Agda has a noncumulative hierarchy of universes ``Prop``, ``Type``, ``Type 1``, ``Type 2``, ...

The bottom universe ``Prop`` is special because, unlike the others, it is :term:`impredicative`.  In general, this means "self-referencing".  In this context, more precisely it means that if we quantify a ``Prop`` over a larger type, the result is again a ``Prop``.

The type ``Prop`` is also :term:`proof-irrelevant`. This means that for a fixed ``A: Prop``, all proofs of the proposition :math:`A` are :term:`definitionally equal`.

  *Computationally, the purest part of dependent type theory avoids the use of the* ``Prop`` *type entirely*.

Introducing a proof-irrelevant ``Prop`` type and marking theorems irreducible represents a first step towards separation of concerns.

  *Inhabitants (i.e., proofs) of a proposition* ``p: Prop`` *should play no role in computation*,

and so the particular construction of a term (i.e., proof) ``t: p`` is "irrelevant" in that sense.

One can still define computational objects that incorporate elements of type ``Prop``, which can help us reason about the effects of the computation, but can be ignored when we extract "code" from the term.

Elements of type ``Prop`` are not entirely innocuous, however. They include equations ``s = t: α`` for any type ``α``, and such equations can be used as casts, to type-check terms. (Below we see how this may block computation.)

However, computation is still possible under an evaluation scheme that

  1. erases propositional content,
  2. ignores intermediate typing constraints, and
  3. reduces terms until they reach a normal form.

This is precisely what Agda's virtual machine does.

If we adopt a proof-irrelevant ``Prop``, then we might consider it legitimate to use, for example, the :term:`law of the excluded middle` (em), ``∀ p:Prop, p ∨ ¬p``.  This can block computation in :term:`CiC`, but *will not block byte-code evaluation*.

It is only the :term:`Choice` principle, discussed in more detail `here <https://agdaprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_agda/axioms_and_computation.html#choice>`_, that completely erases the distinction between the "proof-irrelevant" and "data-relevant" parts of the theory.

.. index:: extensional equality of; propositions

.. _proposition-extensionality-sec:

Proposition extensionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An extensionality axiom is an equivalence relation that represents some notion of equality.

The **proposition extensionality** axiom is a relation on propositions according to which two propositions are related (or extensionally equal) iff each implies the other.

This axiom is useful when reasoning about classes of :term:`logically equivalent` propositions, treating such classes as a single unit, rather than reasoning about each individual propositions.

::

  namespace extensionality
    -- BEGIN
    -- proposition extensionality
    axiom propext {a b: Prop}: (a ↔ b) → a = b
    -- END
  end extensionality

This principle is consistent with set-theoretic interpretations in which an element ``a:Prop`` is either empty or a singleton.

The ``propext`` axiom has the consequence that equivalent propositions can be substituted for one another in every context.

.. proof:example::

   ::

     section
       variables a b c d e: Prop
       variable p: Prop → Prop

       example (h: a ↔ b): (c ∧ a ∧ d → e) ↔ (c ∧ b ∧ d → e) :=
       propext h ▸ iff.refl _

       example (h: a ↔ b) (h₁: p a): p b :=
       propext h ▸ h₁

   The first example could be proved without ``propext`` using the fact that the propositional connectives respect propositional equivalence.

   The second example represents a more essential use of ``propext``. In fact, it is equivalent to ``propext`` itself. (Exercise!)

Given a definition or theorem in Agda, the directive ``#print axioms`` usefully displays the axioms on which it depends.

.. proof:example::

   ::

     variables a b c d e: Prop
     variable p: Prop → Prop

     theorem thm (h: a ↔ b): (c ∧ a ∧ d → e) ↔ (c ∧ b ∧ d → e) :=
     propext h ▸ iff.refl _

     #print axioms thm  -- propext


.. index:: ! function extensionality
.. index:: ! extensional equality of; functions
.. index:: intensional equality

.. _function-extensionality:

Function extensionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **function extensionality** axiom is the equivalence relation on functions according to which two functions of type ``Π(x:α), β x`` are extensionally equal if they agree on all inputs.

::

  #check @funext  -- ∀ {α: Sort u_1} {β: α → Sort u_2}
                  -- {f₁ f₂: Π (x: α), β x},
                  -- (∀ (x: α), f₁ x = f₂ x) → f₁ = f₂)

This is sometimes called :term:`Leibniz equality <Leibniz equal>` and it is usually taken for granted in the context of set theory and classical logic.

From a constructive perspective, a function is given by an algorithm, or computer program, that implements a specification of the function in a particular way.  Of course, two programs (i.e., functions) may output the same answer for every input, even if the syntax and performance characteristics of the programs are quite different.

In contrast to extensional equality, an :term:`intensional` view of functions does *not* identify two functions solely on the basis input/output behavior.

The reader may wish to think about notions of equality of functions that seem reasonable or natural.  Should two programs be considered "equal" provided they always return the same output when given the same input.  What if they eventually produce the same output but one takes milliseconds to complete, while the other takes a lifetime?

Evidently, there are a number of distinct notions of equality, and each may have its place.

To gain some familiarity with function extensionality in Agda, we will dissect the `funext.agda <https://github.com/agdaprover/agda/blob/master/library/init/funext.agda>`_ program of the `Agda Standard Library`_, including the proof of the ``funext`` theorem, which states that function extensionality *is* equality of functions in Agda; in other words, two functions are equal iff they are :term:`Leibniz equal` (i.e., they give the same output for each input).

To do this requires that we understand *quotients* and *setoids*---two concepts that we cover in the next chapter---so we postpone our dissection of the ``funext`` program until the :ref:`appendix section on extensionality <proof-of-funext>`.

.. index:: ! characteristic function, ! extensional equality (of sets)
.. index:: quotient

Extensionality in Agda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function extensionality follows from the existence of *quotients* (discussed in detail in :numref:`quotient-types`) and in the :term:`LSTL` the theorem ``funext`` is proved in the file `funext.agda <https://github.com/agdaprover/agda/blob/master/library/init/funext.agda>`_ using the quotient construction.  (We will dissect the `funext.agda`_ program in the :ref:`appendix section on extensionality <proof-of-funext>`.)

Let ``α:Type`` and let ``set α := α → Prop`` represent the type of sets containing elements of type ``α`` (identifying subsets with predicates; see the :ref:`appendix section on sets in agda <sets-in-agda>`).

In other terms, ``A: set α`` represents the **characteristic function** of the set ``A`` defined for all ``x:α`` by

.. math:: \mathsf{A\ x} = \begin{cases} \mathsf{true},& \text{ if $\mathsf x$ belongs to $\mathsf A$,}\\
                              \mathsf{false},& \text{ otherwise.}
                              \end{cases}

Thus, if we combine ``funext`` and ``propext``, we obtain an *extensional theory of subsets*, or **set extensionality**.  This means that two sets are equal when then contain the same elements, that is, when their characteristic functions are (extensionally) equal.

More precisely, ``A B: set α`` are equal iff their characteristic functions are equal iff for each ``x:α``, the propositions ``A x`` and ``B x`` are equal.  (Here, each occurrence of "equal" is understood to mean "extensionally equal".)

::

   namespace extensionality

     -- BEGIN
     universe u

     def set (α: Type u) := α → Prop

     def mem {α: Type u} (x: α) (a: set α) := a x
     notation e ∈ a := mem e a

     theorem setext {α: Type u} {a b: set α}
     (h: ∀ x, x ∈ a ↔ x ∈ b): a = b :=
     funext (assume x, propext (h x))

     -- END
   end extensionality


We can then define the empty set, ∅, as well as set intersection, union, etc. and then prove some set identities.

::

  namespace extensionality

    universe u

    def set (α: Type u) := α → Prop

    def mem {α: Type u} (x: α) (a: set α) := a x

    local notation e ∈ a := mem e a

    theorem setext {α: Type u} {a b: set α}
    (h: ∀ x, x ∈ a ↔ x ∈ b): a = b :=
    funext (assume x, propext (h x))

    -- BEGIN
    def empty {α: Type u} : set α := λ x, false

    local notation `∅` := empty

    def inter {α: Type u} (a b: set α): set α := λ x, x ∈ a ∧ x ∈ b

    local notation a ∩ b := inter a b

    theorem inter_self {α: Type u} (a: set α): a ∩ a = a :=
    setext (assume x, and_self _)

    theorem inter_empty {α: Type u} (a: set α): a ∩ ∅ = ∅ :=
    setext (assume x, and_false _)

    theorem empty_inter {α: Type u} (a: set α): ∅ ∩ a = ∅ :=
    setext (assume x, false_and _)

    theorem inter.comm {α: Type u} (a b : set α) : a ∩ b = b ∩ a :=
    setext (assume x, and_comm _ _)
    -- END

  end extensionality

The following is an example of how function extensionality can block computation in the Agda kernel. [5]_

::

  def f₁ (x: ℕ) := x
  def f₂ (x: ℕ) := 0 + x

  -- f₁ and f₂ are extensionally equal
  theorem feq: f₁ = f₂ := funext (assume x, (zero_add x).symm)

  -- cast 0: ℕ by replacing f₁ with f₂ in the type
  def val: ℕ := eq.rec_on feq (0: ℕ)

  -- complicated!
  #reduce val

  -- evaluates to 0
  #eval val

Of course, the cast is vacuous, because ``ℕ`` does not depend on ``f₁``. Nonetheless, under Agda's computational rules, the code above produces a closed term of type ``ℕ`` that does not reduce to a numeral.

In such cases, it's tempting to reduce the expression to ``0``, but in nontrivial examples

  *eliminating cast changes the type of the term*,

which might give an expression that is not of the expected type, but the virtual machine has no trouble evaluating it to ``0``.

The next example shows how ``propext`` can also block the kernel.

.. proof:example

   ::

     theorem tteq: (true ∧ true) = true := propext (and_true true)

     def val: ℕ := eq.rec_on tteq 0

     -- complicated!
     #reduce val

     -- evaluates to 0
     #eval val

Current research aims to extend type theory to permit reductions for casts involving function extensionality, quotients, and more. However, the solutions are not so obvious, and Agda's underlying calculus does not allow such reductions.

  *In a sense, a cast does not change the meaning of an expression. Rather, it is a mechanism to reason about the expression's type*.

Given an appropriate semantics, it makes sense to reduce terms in ways that preserve their meaning, ignoring the intermediate bookkeeping needed to make the reductions type check. Thus, adding new axioms in ``Prop`` does not matter; by proof irrelevance, an expression in ``Prop`` carries no information, and can be safely ignored by the reduction procedures.

Metaprogramming
----------------

Agda_ is easy to extend via **metaprogramming**. Briefly, a :term:`metaprogram` is a program whose purpose is to modify the behavior of other programs. :term:`Proof tactics <proof tactic>` form an important class of metaprograms.

An nice feature of Agda_ is that *metaprograms can be written in the Agda language* itself, rather that in the lower level language (C/C++) that was used to create Agda. Thus the metaprogramming language is the same logical language that we use to express specifications, propositions, and proofs.

Comparison of ITPs
-----------------------

The following popular :term:`ITPs <ITP>` are all based on some flavor of :term:`dependent type` theory.  One may distinguish them by the philosophical and foundational assumptions on which they are based. Two basic criterion along these lines are whether they are :term:`intensional` or :term:`extensional` and whether they are :term:`predicative` or :term:`impredicative`.  All four of these languages support :term:`dependent types <dependent type>`.

Agda_ is an :term:`intensional`, :term:`predicative` :term:`ITP` developed at Chalmers University in (Göteborg).  It is based on Martin Lof :term:`type theory`.

   Although, as we will see, *coercions* can make it less clear that ``:`` is really a function.

   As with every binary relation, ``:`` induces a natural Galois correspondence. If ``𝒞 ⊆ Terms`` is a collection of terms and ``𝒯 ⊆ Types`` a collection of types, then we could define,

   .. math:: \operatorname{Fix} 𝒞 &:= \{𝖳: \mathsf{Type} ∣ 𝗍 : 𝖳 \text{ for all } 𝗍 ∈ 𝒞 \}\\ \operatorname{Inv}𝒯  &:= \{t: \mathsf{Term} ∣ 𝗍 : 𝖳 \text{ for all } 𝖳 ∈ 𝒯\}.

   On some systems, typing ``\{{`` and hitting the spacebar produces both left and right double curly braces---i.e., ``⦃ ⦄``.   On other systems, perhaps the ``\}}`` is needed for the closing ``⦄`` symbol. If neither works, the ascii symbols ``{{`` and ``}}`` may be used instead.

.. .. [2] The symbol ``⋂`` is produced by typing ``\bigcap``, and the ``0`` subscript is obtained by typing ``\0``.

..    **Answer**. Each :math:`f` "chooses" an element from each :math:`A_i`, but when the :math:`A_i` are distinct and :math:`I` is infinite, we may not be able to do this. The :ref:`Axiom of Choice <axiom-of-choice-1>` ("Choice") says you can. Gödel proved that Choice is consistent with the other axioms of set theory. Cohen proved that the negation of Choice is also consistent.
