The Agda Universal Algebra Library
==================================

(Version 2.04 of |today|)

.. {{ "now" \| date: "%d %b %Y" }})

Abstract
--------

The `Agda Universal Algebra Library`_ is a collection of
types and programs (theorems and proofs) that formalizes the foundations
of universal algebra in dependent type theory using the Agda_ proof
assistant language.

The library contains definitions of many new types for representing
important constructs and theorems comprising a substantial part of the
foundations of general (universal) algebra and equational logic. These
types are implemented in so called ‚Äúliterate‚Äù Agda files (with the
``.lagda`` extension), and they are grouped into modules which can be
easily imported and integrated into other Agda developments.

To get an idea of the current scope of the library, note that it now
includes a formal proof of Birkhoff‚Äôs `HSP
Theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra)#Birkhoff's_theorem>`__,
which asserts that every *variety* is an *equational class*. That is, if
ùí¶ is a class of algebras which is closed under the taking of homomorphic
images, subalgebras, and arbitrary products, then ùí¶ is the class of all
algebras satisfying some set of identities. To our knowledge, ours is
the first formal, machine-checked proof of Birkhoff‚Äôs Theorem. (If you
have evidence refuting this claim, we would love to hear about it;
please `email us <mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com>`__!)

We hope the library is useful to mathematicians and computer scientists
who wish to formalize their work in dependent type theory and verify
their results with a proof assistant. Indeed, the agda-algebras_
library aims to become an indispensable companion on our mathematical
journeys, helping us authenticate the discoveries we make along the way.

Organization
------------

We have organized the library into a number of modules, called
Overture_, Base_, Setoid_, Demos_, and Examples_, which are imported
below. The modules Base_ and Setoid_ are essentially independent. The
Base_ module contains submodules that comprise the first
version of the library. The Setoid_ contains an alternative version of
the library based on setoids.

The `Demos.HSP`_ module presents a fairly self-contained formal proof
of Birkhoff's HSP Theorem in a single module. In contrast, an alternative version of the proof
is contained in the `Setoid.Varieties.HSP`_ module.  Instead of duplicating everything
needed to be self-contained (as in done in `Demos.HSP`_), the proof in `Setoid.Varieties.HSP`_
imports what it needs from other parts of the agda-algebras_ library.
