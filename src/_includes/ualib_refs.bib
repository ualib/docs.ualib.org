  ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes generic design patterns to define and combine algebraic structures, using dependent records, coercions and type inference, inside the Coq system. This alternative to telescopes in particular supports multiple inheritance, maximal sharing of notations and theories, and automated structure inference. Our methodology is robust enough to handle a hierarchy comprising a broad variety of algebraic structures, from types with a choice operator to algebraically closed fields. Interfaces for the structures enjoy the convenience of a classical setting, without requiring any axiom. Finally, we present two applications of our proof techniques: a key lemma for characterising the discrete logarithm, and a matrix decomposition problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work we present a novel formalization of universal algebra in Agda. We show that heterogeneous signatures can be elegantly modelled in type-theory using sets indexed by arities to represent operations. We prove elementary results of heterogeneous algebras, including the proof that the term algebra is initial and the proofs of the three isomorphism theorems. We further formalize equational theory and prove soundness and completeness. At the end, we define (derived) signature morphisms, from which we get the contravariant functor between algebras; moreover, we also proved that, under some restrictions, the translation of a theory induces a contra-variant functor between models.}
