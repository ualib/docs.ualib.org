Products of Homomorphisms of Algebras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the [Setoid.Homomorphisms.Products] module of the [Agda
Universal Algebra Library][].

Suppose we have an algebra ``𝑨``, a type ``I : Type 𝓘``, and a family
``ℬ : I → Algebra β 𝑆`` of algebras. We sometimes refer to the
inhabitants of ``I`` as *indices*, and call ``ℬ`` an *indexed family of
algebras*.

If in addition we have a family ``𝒽 : (i : I) → hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)`` of
homomorphisms, then we can construct a homomorphism from ``𝑨`` to the
product ``⨅ ℬ`` in the natural way.

\\begin{code}

module \_ {I : Type 𝓘}{𝑨 : Algebra α ρᵃ}(ℬ : I → Algebra β ρᵇ) where
open Algebra 𝑨 using () renaming ( Domain to A ) open Setoid A using ()
renaming ( refl to refl₁ ) open Algebra (⨅ ℬ) using () renaming ( Domain
to ⨅B ) open *⟶* using ( cong ) renaming ( f to *⟨$⟩* ) open Algebra
using ( Domain ) open Setoid using ( refl ) open IsHom

⨅-hom-co : (∀(i : I) → hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)) → hom 𝑨 (⨅ ℬ) ⨅-hom-co 𝒽 = h , hhom
where h : A ⟶ ⨅B \_⟨\ :math:`⟩_ h = λ a i → ∣ 𝒽 i ∣ ⟨`\ ⟩ a cong h xy i
= cong ∣ 𝒽 i ∣ xy hhom : IsHom 𝑨 (⨅ ℬ) h compatible hhom = λ i →
compatible ∥ 𝒽 i ∥

\\end{code}

The family ``𝒽`` of homomorphisms inhabits the dependent type
``Π i ꞉ I , hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)``. The syntax we use to represent this type is
available to us because of the way ``-Π`` is defined in the [Type
Topology][] library. We like this syntax because it is very close to the
notation one finds in the standard type theory literature. However, we
could equally well have used one of the following alternatives, which
may be closer to “standard Agda” syntax:

``Π λ i → hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)``   or   ``(i : I) → hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)``   or  
``∀ i → hom 𝑨 (ℬ i)``.

The foregoing generalizes easily to the case in which the domain is also
a product of a family of algebras. That is, if we are given
``𝒜 : I → Algebra α 𝑆 and ℬ : I → Algebra β 𝑆`` (two families of
``𝑆``-algebras), and ``𝒽 :  Π i ꞉ I , hom (𝒜 i)(ℬ i)`` (a family of
homomorphisms), then we can construct a homomorphism from ``⨅ 𝒜`` to
``⨅ ℬ`` in the following natural way.

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{code}

    -- ⨅-hom : (𝒜 : I → Algebra α ρᵃ) → (∀ (i : I) → hom (𝒜 i) (ℬ i)) → hom (⨅ 𝒜)(⨅ ℬ)
    -- ⨅-hom 𝒜 𝒽 = {!!} -- (λ x i → ∣ 𝒽 i ∣ (x i)) , (λ 𝑓 𝒶 → λ i → ∥ 𝒽 i ∥ 𝑓 (λ x → 𝒶 x i))

   \end{code}

Projection out of products
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Later we will need a proof of the fact that projecting out of a product
algebra onto one of its factors is a homomorphism.

\\begin{code}

– ⨅-projection-hom : (i : I) → hom (⨅ ℬ) (ℬ i) – ⨅-projection-hom = {!!}
– λ x → (λ z → z x) , λ \_ \_ → ≡.refl

\\end{code}

We could prove a more general result involving projections onto multiple
factors, but so far the single-factor result has sufficed.
